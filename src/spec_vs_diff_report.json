  "summary": "The diff shows changes to EntryCard.tsx that implement full-width text for journal entries. The key change is applying 'px-6 -mx-6' classes to the entry text paragraph, which effectively removes horizontal padding constraints by offsetting the parent container's padding, allowing the text to span the full width of the card while maintaining consistent alignment with the timestamp and action buttons above it.",
