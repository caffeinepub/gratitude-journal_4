# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand journal entry text to full width within entry cards.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove horizontal padding from journal entry text content so it spans the full width of the card container
- Ensure text width matches the width of the timestamp and action buttons (edit/delete) above it

**User-visible outcome:** Journal entry text will extend to the full width of the entry card, aligning with the date/time stamp and buttons above it, providing a more spacious reading experience.
