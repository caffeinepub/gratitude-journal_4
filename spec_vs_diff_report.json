  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all three requirements: REQ-18 (full-screen photo viewer modal), REQ-19 (navigation arrows and keyboard controls), and REQ-20 (voice-to-text transcription fix). The PhotoViewer component was added with all requested functionality, EntryCard was modified to integrate the viewer, and the voice-to-text bug was fixed in both EntryForm and useSpeechRecognition hook by using a ref to persist transcript state.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'Adding photo metadata display in the viewer' as a non-goal, and the image counter was not requested in any requirement or acceptance criteria",
