## Summary
**Goal:** Add full-screen photo viewer with navigation between multiple images and fix voice-to-text transcription bug where text disappears after recording.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement full-screen photo viewer modal that opens when clicking photo thumbnails
- Add navigation arrows to swipe between multiple photos in entries with multiple images
- Fix voice-to-text transcription bug where transcribed text disappears from textarea

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click photos to view them full-screen with navigation arrows to browse multiple photos, and voice-to-text transcriptions will persist in the textarea without disappearing.
