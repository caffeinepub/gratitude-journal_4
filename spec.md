# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the journal entry text in EntryCard full width by moving the edit/delete buttons out of the inline text row and into a dedicated area below the entry text.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove width constraints on the entry text so it spans the full width of the card
- Reposition the edit and delete buttons to a dedicated row or footer below the entry text
- Ensure the updated layout works correctly in both light and dark themes

**User-visible outcome:** Journal entry text now occupies the full card width, and the edit/delete buttons appear below the text in their own row, remaining clearly visible and tappable.
